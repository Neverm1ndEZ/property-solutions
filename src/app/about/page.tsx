						Property Solutions is a real estate firm working across Greater
						Noida, the Yamuna Expressway and Sikandrabad. We handle the sale and
						purchase of residential, commercial and industrial property — from a
						single plot to a full warehouse site.
					</p>
					<p>
						Buying land here usually starts with the authority layout plan, and
						those plans are hard to find. So we put every one we have on this
						site, free to view and download at full resolution. Find your sector,
						check the plot, then call us about what is actually available.
					</p>
					<p>
						We work on clear documentation, honest pricing and a straight answer
						about what a plot is worth. Payment by cash, cheque, card or money
						order. We are open {HOURS}.
